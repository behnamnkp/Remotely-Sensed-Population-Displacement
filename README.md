# Displace, Return, and Reconstruct: Population Movement and Resilience to Instability

Reliable information about large population displacement and return resulting from wars and armed conflicts is fundamental to plan and deliver humanitarian aids and post-war recovery services. However, field data collection is usually not possible due to the potential risks. Remote sensing could solve this problem. On the one hand, Longitudinal land use products derived from very high-resolution images distinguish human residential areas from other land cover (e.g., vegetation) and land use (e.g., industrial zones) and recognizes potential changes due to damage or development. On the other hand, nightlight reveals the presence and density of the population. In this project, we assessed the potential of remote sensing to estimate the population displacement and return before and after a conflict. 

This project was part of a grant funded by Minerva Research Initiative and the Army Research Office (PI: [Dr. Jim Walsh](https://jamesigoewalsh.com/), Co-PI: [Dr. Jean-Claude Thill](https://pages.charlotte.edu/jean-claude-thill/), [Dr. Jacob Aronson](https://cidcm.umd.edu/facultyprofile/aronson/jacob)).

## Technologies Used

- Tensorflow, Geopandas, Shapely, Rasterio, Arcpy
- R version 4.2.3 (2023-03-15 ucrt)
- Matlab 2020b
- Wget

## Features
- The project involves performing high-resolution landuse classification using deep learning techniques.
- A unique training dataset is created specifically for an urban area in a Middle Eastern country.
- Geospatial applications typically handle raster and vector data types, and integrating these data types can be challenging. This project addresses this challenge by providing dasymetric solutions within the repository.
- By incorporating powerful spatial statistical models, the project enhances the remote sensing of population displacement, adding valuable insights to the analysis.

## Getting Started
To get started with the Remotely-Sensed-Population-Displacement repository, follow these steps:

1. Make a request to access the data
2. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/behnamnkp/Behavioral-Interventions.git`
2. Organize directories as in the folder structure
3. Make sure you use the right versions of Python and R
4. Install the required dependencies in `requirements.txt`
5. Configure the flags and paths in the `.config.json` file

## Usage
Once you organize files and directories, you will be able to run the code.

## Examples

We test our approach in Mosul, Iraq during a five years (2014-2018) of armed conflict.
